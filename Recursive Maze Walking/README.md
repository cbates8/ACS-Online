# Maze Definition - Recursion

### This project uses the principles of recursion to define and solve a randomized maze.

This program recursively generates a random maze. The turtle object will then use a recursive algorithm to search the maze for the goal object. Once found, the turtle will take the shortest path from the starting cell to the goal.
