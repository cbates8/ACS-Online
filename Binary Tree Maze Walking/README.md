# Binary Tree Maze Defintion and Walking

### This project creates a randomly generated maze that is completed using a binary tree.

To create the maze, a grid is generated and wall are erased to create passageways. Each cell is numbered to be used by the walker in a binary tree.

To walk the maze, the turtle object views the maze as a binary tree. Using this tree, it will calculate the shortest path from the first cell to the last cell in the maze.
