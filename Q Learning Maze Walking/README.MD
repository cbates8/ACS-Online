# Maze Walking - Q Learning

### This project uses the machine learning algorithm known as Q Learning to solve a randomly generated maze

Q Learning is a machine learning technique that is classified as "reinforcement learning." More information on Q Learning can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning">HERE</a>, and <a href="http://mnemstudio.org/path-finding-q-learning-tutorial.htm">HERE</a>.

After a maze is randomly generated, a turtle object will use a Q Learning algorithm to find the shortest path to the goal. Rather than just walking through the maze repeatedly until the goal is found, this algorithm allows the walker object to "learn" the maze before walking it.
