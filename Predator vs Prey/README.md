# Predator vs Prey

### This project uses Python's Turtle Graphics library and principles of object-oriented programming to have one turtle object "hunt" the other.

Version 1: Programing the "predator" turtle to "smell" the "prey" turtle. When the "smell" gets stronger (less distance between the two objects) the "predator" will continue moving in the current direction.

Version 2: Programming the "prey" to move in a circle, as to make it harder for the "predator" to track and catch it.

Version 3: In this version, I made improvements to the "predator" and "prey" turtle objects to make "hunt" more effectively and "survive" longer respectively. Then I teamed up with a classmate to run my "predator" versus their "prey" and vice versa (I have only included my "predator" and "prey" code in this repository).
